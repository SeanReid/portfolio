<section class='post-content'><p>I quit my 3+yr job with Verizon on May 29, 2014 with no job lined up! I mentioned before I have a family, right? It was for sure the right thing for me and my family. I was working at a job I once liked and had since turned to hate. It was because I was working in a field I had no passion for. I had talked with Samantha for many years about saving enough to quit, do a bootcamp and get my dream job. I got to work on the 29th and just KNEW I couldn’t go in. I knew it was time to take action and I did. I searched nearly every bootcamp I could find and realized many are way more than I had a budget for. Thankfully, I found The Iron Yard on Jun 5th and wasn’t 100% sure because the next session wasn’t until sometime late July. I needed to get going now! I saw online there was a session that had started June 2nd so I was too late. I happened to find Jesse on @jwo and saw he tweeted there were 2 spots remaining. I called in the morning and was making travel plans by the evening! It has been a whirlwind since. I need to mention I live(d) in VA and this session was in Houston! I would recommend if you have to relocate, plan ahead. I have been juggling moving the family every weekend since I got here. One was a dirty place, the next in a bad area and the next too far away. This week I think we have long term arrangements so I will have extra coding time to replace my travel time. Stay tuned…

This week we moved from Ruby into a Git and HTML/CSS. Git is a simple concept but less easy to use. After a few mistaken repo creations and origin errors I think I have the basics down. Whats great is just like Ruby if a peer doesn't have the answer surely the open source community has the answer. This website was built using Middleman and learned HTML/CSS from the past few days. Every week it’s awesome to look back and see what was a mystery is now a learned skill. It’s also exciting looking ahead and knowing the cycle is going to repeat itself. Front end development isn’t something I though I would love and I was so wrong. Seems like every new topic is even better than the last, on to week 4!
